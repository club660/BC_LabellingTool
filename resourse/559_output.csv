"However, I would ask that should her lipid profile show an LDL above 1.6, that you consider changing Simvastatin to Rosuvastatin.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would start at 10mg Rosuvastatin concurrently with 10mg of Ezetimibe for 3 months with a repeat LDL and lipid profile to guide further gradual titration at that time.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Dear Dr Wong,





RE:	ROBERT OWEN JONES	DOB:	08/02/1935	UR:	495143

							

														

														I invited Mr Jones to attend today to discuss 2 issues.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
He attended with his son Neil.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Firstly, Robert’s pacemaker generator is subject to a hazard alert issued by the manufacturer late last year.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
This involves a 1/600 risk of sudden failure of the pulse generator.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is relevant to Robert because he is completely dependent on pacemaker function.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
We discussed the options for the way forward.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Robert could elect to have the pulse generator replaced electively for peace of mind, but this would entail risks of another procedure, including infection at up to 2%.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Robert would like to think about this more and discuss further with his family.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have indicated to him that should he decide on elective replacement of the pulse generator, he should let me know by leaving a message in the Cardiology Office at this hospital, or by contacting yourself.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Should he develop dizziness or syncope he should proceed to hospital immediately.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The second issue is the detection of about 15 seconds of ventricular tachycardia on his pacemaker telemetry overnight by remote monitoring.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Robert does not have any cardiac symptoms and he is quite well in himself.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
His blood pressure was 140/75mmHg.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
There were no abnormal cardiac signs whatsoever.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
He does not have angina or dyspnoea.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the absence of associated features, I do not believe that specific therapy of the detected arrhythmia will be of benefit for Robert.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"However, of course we will continue with remote monitoring of his pacemaker which is 2 years old and performing well to this point.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Dear Dr App, 





														RE:	JODIE KAYROUZ		DOB:	20/09/1984		UR:	772620

																							MTR:	1065126							

														Thank you for your letter referring Jodie for review regarding the result of her exercise stress test.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
This was performed presumably as a potentially diagnostic test for long QT syndrome.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Your referral related to arrhythmia did not contain any ECG documentation.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would not refer a patient with a fracture to an Orthopaedic Surgeon without submitting an x-ray – the principle is the same.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, we spent some time obtaining from your medical records department, copies of all of the ECG data obtained during the stress test.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
There was concern that her corrected QT interval increased at peak exercise.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The problem with this is that that measurement was made by the ECG computer, which has included the subsequent P-wave in the QT measurement.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, I spent some more time measuring manually the QT intervals from each recorded stage of your treadmill test.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Corrected QT interval was 430ms at the start of the test, with heart rate 87bpm.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The corrected QT reduced progressively to 335ms at peak exercise and return to resting levels without hysteresis.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Accordingly, the stress test does not indicate concern regarding long QT syndrome.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Furthermore, Jodie is currently taking (potentially QT-prolonging) Ondansetron every day for control of hyperemesis during her 7th pregnancy, and her corrected QT interval today remains at 430ms.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jodie does not have any cardiac symptoms at all, in particular, none of syncope, seizure or dizziness which is not related to her pregnancy.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
She does not have agonal nocturnal breathing.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You did send along the echocardiography report, which also shows no concern.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I note this lady’s family history including the sudden death of a cousin aged 13, while swimming.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is possible that her mother has long QT syndrome, which contributed to cardiac arrest last year and subsequent ICD implantation.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You report that the patient has undergone genetic testing at RBWH, which was negative for detection of long QT syndrome related genes.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, in summary, we have no substantial evidence of long QT syndrome in this lady, and I have informed her accordingly.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"He saw the Respiratory people at Redland Hospital, and I note his respiratory function testing is satisfactory, apart from his low DLCO at 60%.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would note that clinically he has bilateral fibrotic lung crackles on the left base greater than right.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you for performing the stress test which shows that he has at least moderately severe aortic stenosis and a similar degree of mitral regurgitation.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There was concern that perhaps he had an anterior wall motion abnormality, but he is known to have residual distal LAD disease.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr Martini is adamant that he no longer gets angina.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He does however have significant valvular heart disease.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I would be happy if that was up titrated if he developed recurrent angina, but I think if we make him less bradycardic, that might be helpful.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it is a useful test.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is favored to represent to represent a thrombus in setting of subtherapeutic INRs on warfarin.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
He has had serial echocardiograms which show reducing size of thrombus over time but still not fully resolved on the latest echocardiogram performed at the QEII Hospital in December 2022 - the pictures are not available to me today for review.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He has been well with therapeutic INR’s via QML, the last one being 2.8 on 06.01.2023.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
He has a normal second mechanical heart sound and there is a soft pain systolic murmur.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
He is euvolaemic today.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"From urology perspective, the preference is that they perform TURP without anticoagulation on board if feasible and safe.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We recommend that he undergoes inpatient bridging with either unfractionated Heparin preferably or low molecular weight heparin.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"His APTT ideally should be therapeutic all the time as much as feasible and if LMWH is used, anti-Xa level could be checked- we recommend Haematology advice.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our advice is that interruption of anticoagulation is kept to minimum and post procedure he should be bridged back onto warfarin when the surgical team is happy.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This ideally should be done as an inpatient, rather than in the community as he is at high risk of complications from his mechanical valve.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

														I invited John for review today because the manufacturer of his pacemaker generator has issued a hazard alert.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
This involves a 1 out of 600 risk of sudden failure of the device.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Since John is dependent on his pacemaker, this is a very relevant issue for him.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We discussed elective replacement of the pacemaker pulse generator for peace of mind, but with risks of a further procedure, including up to 2% risk of infection and significant risk of bleeding.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I remember John well from his last pacemaker procedure here.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"At the time of generator replacement, lead fracture occurred at the junction with the pacemaker header requiring immediate insertion of a new lead.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For several days afterwards he had significant ongoing blood ooze from the superficial part of his wound, requiring him to be hospitalised for that time.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Subsequent surveillance was satisfactory over a period of a couple of months.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I understand that he is participating in the FINEARTS trial at the RBWH.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
He has had significant shortness of breath on exertion associated with diastolic left ventricular impairment to which atrial fibrillation may have contributed.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Fortunately, his atrial fibrillation has remitted, since persistent left atrial appendage thrombus has prevented safe cardioversion attempts.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"John has anginal discomfort at his upper sternum and throat, which is rather unpredictable and usually occurs at rest these days.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
His described pattern of exertional dyspnoea suggests that there is an element of chronotropic incompetence.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Accordingly, I have increased very slightly the rate response of his pacemaker system today.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have invited him to our Device Timing Clinic for echocardiographic optimisation of pacemaker timing cycles in order to optimise left ventricular filling.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will report further thereafter.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Amiodarone may be contributing to this as well as to his vivid dreams.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
In frequently he can develop orthopnoea.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have suggested that he should take his 20mg of Telmisartan at night instead of in the morning and to split his dosage of Frusemide to 20mg in the morning plus a further 20mg at about 4pm in the afternoon.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
John is not sure whether he has had a recent thyroid function test.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thyroid and liver function tests should be performed each 6 months with continuing Amiodarone therapy.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

														I share a Cardiology Clinic on Wednesday mornings with Cardiothoracic Surgeon, Dr Wing Lo.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He asked me to look at Elisha’s angiogram pictures, after she was referred from Ipswich Hospital to our Cardiothoracic Surgeons for consideration of bypass surgery.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Dr Lo had pretty serious reservations about Elisha’s candidacy for bypass surgery, including the fact that LAD does not look graftable as well as her smoking and COPD, body habitus and general young age.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I thought it was worthwhile trying a PCI approach to her LAD.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is a pretty short segment chronic total occlusion, which leads into an LAD diagonal bifurcation.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The vessel looks very small and underfilled (part of the reason it is not graftable), but it may well plump up after balloon dilatation and intracoronary nitro-glycerine.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It would need to pump up to about 2mm or more, to be able to take a stent.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hopefully then we would be able to provisionally stent the LAD and leave the small diagonal alone.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"She has several cortisone injections coming up in the next few weeks on her trigger fingers, shoulder and possibly some more injection on her spine.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have suggested she all of these dealt with in the next 2 weeks and start Clopidogrel after this.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
She would then need to be on the Clopidogrel for at least a week before we do the stenting.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
That would take us through to about late February which probably fits with out waiting list anyway.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

														It was a pleasure to review Mark in the Cardiology Outpatient Clinic today.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
He is a 45-year-old gentleman who had a number of presentations to hospital this year with a somewhat complicated course.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He was initially admitted to the RBWH in early July with chest pain, anterior ECG changes and a modest troponin elevation.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
He had an invasive coronary angiogram that demonstrated no severe obstructive coronary artery disease.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
He had a cardiac MRI that suggested an LAD territory infarct.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He then presented to the PA Hospital on 18.08.2022 with similar symptoms, ECG changes and troponin elevation.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
His LV function was normal on echocardiogram and a repeat angiogram demonstrated a proximal LAD lesion that was not thought to be haemodynamically significant on IFR.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
A repeat cardiac MRI was planned but he discharged against medical advice.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He was prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy, a statin and Isosorbide Mononitrate on discharge for likely coronary artery spasm.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"After that, he continued to experience frequent GTN responsive chest pain.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
He failed to attend a scheduled outpatient review.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
He continued to smoke cigarettes.,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He reported compliance with his medications, though his dispensing history was not consistent with that.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He denied any recent use of methamphetamines, though he had previously smoked them.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He was then admitted on 29.10.2022, again with chest pain and a troponin rise.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
On this occasion he had a significant decline in his LV function.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
His EF was 42% on a cardiac MRI with evidence of LAD scar that was minimally viable.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
A CTCA demonstrated a mild to moderate ostial LAD stenosis due to soft plaque extending back into the distal left main.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The initial plan was to manage Mark with aggressive medical therapy for coronary artery disease, possible coronary artery spasm and LV dysfunction as well as strongly encourage abstinence from methamphetamines and cigarettes.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"However, he continued to experience quite frequent GTN responsive chest pain despite maximum tolerated medical therapy.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He subsequently underwent coronary angiography, OCT and FFR of the LAD.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The angiographic appearance was unchanged and there was no severe stenosis on angiography.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"However, OCT revealed a diffusely diseased LAD with fibroatheroma and evidence of plaque erosion at the mid vessel and ostium.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
FFR was 0.75 in the LAD post-hyperaemia.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
"The option of PCI was discussed based on the appearance of unstable plaque, haemodynamically significant FFR and recurrent symptoms despite medical therapy, acknowledging there was no angiographically severe stenosis and borderline viability on cardiac MRI.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
There were concerns regarding Mark’s compliance with medical therapy in the setting of a stent.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
This was discussed with him and the consequences of non-compliance including acute stent thrombosis were raised.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was also discussed with his sister.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mark decided to persist with medical therapy and was discharged from hospital.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"His medications on discharge were Aspirin 100mg, Ticagrelor 90mg BD, Bisoprolol 5mg, Irbesartan 75mg, Isosorbide Mononitrate 120mg, Nicorandil 5mg BD, Eplerenone 12.5mg, Empagliflozin 10mg, Rosuvastatin 40mg.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mark reports that his main issue since discharge has been fatigue and exhaustion.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
This limits his exercise tolerance.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
He also reports episodes of chest pain which mainly occur at night when he lays down to go to bed or when he wakes up in the morning.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They can also sometimes occur after exertion, but not particularly with it.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
These episodes have all been quickly relieved with GTN.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mark reports good compliance with his medications, only missing a couple of doses since discharge.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"However, his pulse was 84bpm and regular today and his blood pressure was 140/85mmHg.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Given his heart rate and blood pressure were significantly lower when he was on hospital on medical therapy, to the point where we could not titrate his medical therapy any further, I wonder if today’s readings may represent some poor compliance with medications.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mark also brought in his medication boxes today, asking for repeat prescriptions, and I noticed that most were dispensed in November with significant supply left.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think Mark may be well intentioned and trying to take his medications regularly but probably missing a significant proportion of doses.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mark asked about PCI today.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I explained that PCI may not address his current chest pain as it is not exertional and there may still be some component of coronary spasm given the quick relief with GTN.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
We also rediscussed the critical importance of medication compliance if he were to have a proximal LAD stent.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have given Mark a full set of prescriptions today and strongly encouraged him to obtain a Webster Pack from his local pharmacy.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have suggested increasing the Bisoprolol to 7.5mg.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will review him in 3 months but please feel free to contact me with any issues or concerns in the interim.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Leslie underwent a cardiac MRI that revealed RCA territory scar but a viable LAD territory.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
