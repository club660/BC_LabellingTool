"There were no resting regional wall motion abnormalities, but there was an increased left ventricular wall thickness.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation was seen on screening images with a mildly dilated ascending aorta at 38mm.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
She exercised for 9 minutes and 32 seconds and achieved 89% of her maximum predicted heart rate and 10.8METs.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
She did not experience any chest pain during the stress test.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
